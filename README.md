## Course Objectives

- Load and fine-tune pre-trained transformer models
- Apply optimization techniques: distillation, pruning, quantization
- Deploy models using FastAPI, Gradio, Docker, and AWS ECS
- Implement production best practices

## Getting Started

### Option 1: Google Colab (Recommended)
Open any notebook directly in Colab:
```
https://colab.research.google.com/github/[your-repo]/blob/main/[notebook-path]
```

> **Tip:** An easy way to convert a Jupyter Notebook from GitHub to Google Colab is by changing `https://github.com/...` to `https://githubtocolab.com/...` in the URL.

### Option 2: Local Setup
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter lab
```
