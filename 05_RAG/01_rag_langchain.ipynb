                "**Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a powerful technique that enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by providing them with access to external data sources. This approach addresses a key limitation of LLMs: while they are trained on vast amounts of public data, they lack knowledge of your *private* data (e.g., company documents, personal files, or proprietary databases).\n",
